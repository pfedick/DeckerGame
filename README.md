This is my attempt of writing a Jump'n'Run game in C++. It uses the [Simple DirectMedia Layer](https://www.libsdl.org/) library for graphics and my own library [pplib](https://github.com/pfedick/pplib) for graphics and ui.

It features George Decker, one of the main characters of my Lego(tm) stopmotion film [The Adventures Of Charlie and George Decker](https://youtu.be/-aJDTe_obKI), which I made a few years ago and is available on YouTube.


## What's the status of the game?
The game is in very early development, which means I know a few things I want to build into it, but I have to figure out how to do it. This includes:
- which resolution should the game have
- what ist the best size for tiles and sprites?
- how to build and render the tile-based world (tiles, layers)
- how to move in the world (side scrolling, paralax)
- how to implement the sprites?
- movement of sprites
- how to control the main character?
- collision detection
- game mechanics (hallways, doors, traps, ladders, walk, run, jump, fall) 
- how does sound work with SDL?
- how to integrate sound track and sound effects
- create graphics
- compose soundtrack
- create sound effects
- build the world/levels
- story?

## On what platforms will the game be available
My target platforms are:

- Linux (development is done on Fedora 34)
- Windows 10

The game will be open source and uses the [Simple DirectMedia Layer](https://www.libsdl.org/) library, which is available on many platforms. So in therory it should be possible to compile it on any platform with a c++ compiler and the SDL library.

## When will it come out?
I don't know. This is one of my hobbies, but I have others, too :-)
Maybe I will never finish it or decide to do something else. We will see...

## How to compile

TODO
